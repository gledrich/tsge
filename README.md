# TSGE - TypeScript Game Engine

## Usage

### Installation

```bash
npm i
```

### Playground

```bash
npm run playground
```

This will bring up a server running the playground on port [3000](http://localhost:3000). Have a look at the [Example](https://github.com/gledrich/tsge/blob/main/Example/index.js) if you're looking for ideas. The sprite is already included in the playground.

_Note: No need to call `window.onload`, just create a `new DemoGame()` after the definition._
